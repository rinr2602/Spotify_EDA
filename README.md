# Spotify Dataset Analysis

This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a comprehensive Spotify tracks dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes various attributes of songs such as duration, popularity, explicit content, genres, and artist details.

## Project Overview

The analysis covers three main areas:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Converted song duration from milliseconds to hh:mm:ss format.
   - Analyzed distributions and outliers in song popularity and duration.

2. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Explored distributions of song popularity, duration, explicit vs. non-explicit songs, and more.
   - Identified top songs, unique artists, and genre distributions.

3. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:**
   - Investigated correlations between song duration/popularity, genre-specific popularity, and artist song count vs. average popularity.
   - Explored how explicit content affects popularity, genre-specific song durations, and more complex relationships.

4. **Advanced Analysis:**
   - Examined top artists by average popularity, genre-specific popularity insights, and differences in song characteristics (duration, explicit content) among top genres and artists.
   - Identified outliers in song duration and popularity and analyzed their impact.

## Key Insights

- **Popularity and Duration:** Found no significant correlation between song duration and popularity.
- **Genre-Specific Insights:** Rock and dance genres tend to have higher average popularity scores.
- **Artist Analysis:** Explored differences in popularity among albums of the same artist and across different genres.
- **Explicit Content:** Explicit songs tend to have slightly higher average popularity than non-explicit songs.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing song popularity on Spotify, including genre preferences, artist influence, and the impact of explicit content. The findings can be useful for music industry professionals, analysts, and enthusiasts interested in understanding music trends and consumer preferences.
